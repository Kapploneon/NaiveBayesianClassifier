Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
==================================

Hanlin He, Tao Wang

The Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier is implemented in Java SE 1.8.

## Structure

There are two classes, 'Driver' and 'TrainAndTestNB'.

The 'english.txt' is used to contain all the stopwords.

## Compilation

The easy way to compile is using javac to generate two classes from java source code.
	
## Execution

We run the test on the first two, three, ... twenty folders of data. The results are listed below.

Analysis of Testing Results

It is obvious that testing accuracy is decreasing when the number of folders increases.
